# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was for Bobby to show his manager a breakdown of the employees that are nearing retirement. We broke down the eligible retirees by title in order for us to have a better idea of which departments and titles will be open in the near future. This anaylsis will help the company determine what jobs we will be hiring for once these employees retire so we are better prepared for the future. We also did an analysis to determine which employees were eligible for the mentorship program.

## Results
We determined that there is a large amount of employees nearing retirement. 
We need to prepare for the "Silver Tsunami" that is nearing.
There are large amounts of employees retiring from several titles as shown below.

We also have a decent amount of employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary
Due to the ensuing "silver tsunami" there are many roles that will need to be filled. We will have 90,398 roles opening during the time in which employees will be retiring. We need to prepare to take action during this time to fill these roles as they open. 

Compared to the amount of roles that will need to be filled, we do not have enough qualified, retirement ready employees to mentor the next generation. We only have 1,940 employees that are eligible for mentorship program for Pewlett Hackard.
